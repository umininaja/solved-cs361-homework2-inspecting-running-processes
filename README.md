In the last homework you looked at the symbol table of your own compiled program. This time we’ll be watching and interacting with precompiled programs as they execute.

Before you start, please make sure to log in systems[1-4].cs.uic.edu (e.g. systems1, systems2, etc.).

The skeleton code for this assignment is available at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclassroom.github.com%2Fa%2FWfIHo7e4&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEJAqKifnpwqo0Hpmx1qOcTJWSbw">this link</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclassroom.github.com%2Fa%2FWfIHo7e4&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEJAqKifnpwqo0Hpmx1qOcTJWSbw">.</a> You must use GitHub classroom to write your code and keep a commit log on GitHub. You will submit your files via Gradescope.

Your task will be to fill out two files in your personal repository called secrets.txt and howto.txt.

The format for secrets.txt should be:

<ol>

 <li>these</li>

 <li>are</li>

 <li>not</li>

 <li>real</li>

 <li>secrets</li>

</ol>

howto.txt is also <strong>required</strong>: you must describe in English how to find the secret for that given executable. Each individual howto should be on one more more lines after a line with only the executable number and a period on it, like so:

<ol>

 <li></li>

</ol>

For this one, I had to:

* Run a specific unix utility to learn some specific information  * Perform some specific task that I found out about by checking part of a specific line in the output of the unix utility.  …

Your howto.txt should enable any other CS 361 student to find the password within a minute of reading it.

<h2>Warning</h2>

You must complete this assignment on systems[1-4].cs.uic.edu. Failure to do so will result in a zero.

You will not be given any other files to complete secret findings except the 5 executable files.

<strong>Hints:</strong>

Open your howto.txt alongside your shell as you work on each executable file, and use it to take notes. If you don’t give a full description of how to arrive at the answer, you may not receive points.

The content of lab section will be incredibly helpful for this assignment. If you miss it, ask someone that went if they’re willing to share their notes with you.

<strong>Template</strong>

The executable files are available in the classroom repository and can be accessed using the link above.
